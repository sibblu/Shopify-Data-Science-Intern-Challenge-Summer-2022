On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 
<ol type='a'>
    <li><b>Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.</b>
        <ul>
        <li><i>The naive calculation of AOV ($3145.13) is wrong because it simply takes the mean of <b>"order_amount",i.e., sum of order_amount/number_of_orders (5000)</b>. Which doesn't gives a true picture because of presence of high volume (no. of items in order) orders, which skews the AOV. <b>Therefore, quantity of items in an order(total_items) and amount_per_item (new attribute, = order_amount/total_items) should be taken into account,</b> outliers should be removed with careful analysis.
        </i>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>What metric would you report for this dataset? </b>
        <ul>
        <li><i>After analysing and removing outliers, we get following: </i>
            <li>Order values Mean: $302.5, Median: $284.0, Mode:$153</li>
            <li>amount_per_item values, Mean: $151.79, Median: $153.0, Mode: $153.0.</li>
            <li>total_items values, Mean:1.9947336439133077, Median:2.0, Mode:2</li>
            <li>When total_items per order = 2 (mode) [1816 such orders], order_amount Mean: $303.5, Median:306.0, Mode:306</li>
        </li>
        <li><b>Given above observations, it can be concluded that mean (average) order value $302.5 gives better picture of AOV. Even in case of most frequent orders with "total_item" = 2, the mean order value $303.5 is close to the general mean value ( $302.5).</b>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is its value?
        <ul><li><b>$302.5</b></li>
        </ul>
